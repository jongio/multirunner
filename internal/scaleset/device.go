// newDeviceClient builds a scale set client authenticated with a GitHub App
// device-flow user access token.
//
// The scale set library captures the token at construction and re-sends it (as a
// Bearer header) whenever it refreshes its Actions admin session, which can be
// hours into a long-lived session — by then a user token has expired. A
// refreshing transport intercepts exactly that header and swaps in a freshly
// refreshed token, leaving every other request (notably the RemoteAuth
// admin-token calls that drive the long-poll and job acquisition) untouched.

	// type-asserts HTTPClient.Transport to *http.Transport, so replacing the
	// transport makes the admin-connection call fail outright. The hook sees the
	// same request and leaves the transport's concrete type alone. It cannot
	// return an error, so a failed refresh leaves the stale header and surfaces
	// as the API's own 401.
